    abstract = "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.",

However, applying Transformer models to 3D medical image datasets presents significant challenges due to their high training time, and memory requirements, which not only hinder scalability but also contribute to elevated CO$\_2$ footprint. This has led to an exploration of alternative models that can maintain or even improve performance while being more efficient and environmentally sustainable. Recent advancements in Structured State Space Models (SSMs) effectively address some of the inherent limitations of Transformers, particularly their high memory and computational demands. Inspired by these advancements, we propose an efficient 3D segmentation model for medical imaging called SegResMamba, designed to reduce computation complexity, memory usage, training time, and environmental impact while maintaining high performance. Our model uses less than half the memory during training compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures, achieving comparable performance with significantly reduced resource demands.",

We propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process, preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a scale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and inter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by enhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we refer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating its efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

Contrary to prior assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen, domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM), a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify regions of high certainty.

    abstract = "2D Freehand echocardiography remains the primary imaging modality for routine fetal cardiac care, essential in the antenatal detection of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). However, there is a lack of spatial context which requires 3D imaging. Current 3D methods, such as Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation (STIC), face limitations in success rate, image quality, and ease of use, and come at the cost of lower spatial and temporal resolution compared to 2D acquisitions. This work studies the feasibility of aligning real high spatial and temporal resolution 2D fetal echocardiography into a reference 3D space defined by lower resolution 3D STIC. FERN, a $\textbf{F}$etal $\textbf{E}$chocardiography $\textbf{R}$egistration $\textbf{N}$etwork, employs transformers for standard fetal echocardiography view alignment. The network is trained on simulated 2D slices derived from 3D volumes at end-diastole, and validated on real 2D acquisitions from fetuses with Coarctation of the Aorta and Right Aortic Arch diagnoses, achieving a mean Euclidean distance of 2.98 $\pm$ 1.27 mm on cardiac region-of-interest points between predicted and manually selected planes. Compared to manually aligned planes, improved image similarity to an average atlas is achieved, confirmed by blinded best plane selection. This work demonstrates that high spatial and temporal resolution 2D fetal echocardiography can be integrated into a 3D context provided by lower-resolution 3D acquisitions or fetal cardiac atlases, potentially resulting in a new 3D visualization tool for enhanced CHD diagnosis.",

    abstract = "Accurate quantitative measurement in lung computed tomography (CT) imaging often relies on consistent kernel reconstruction across scanners and manufacturers. Harmonization can reduce measurement variability caused by heterogeneous reconstruction kernels; however, harmonization across different manufacturers and scanners remains challenging due to significant differences in reconstruction protocol and positional alignment of subjects, often resulting in anatomical hallucinations. To address this, we propose a multi-path cycleGAN framework that incorporates multi-region anatomical labels and a tissue statistic loss as anatomical regularization to preserve structural integrity during harmonization. We trained our model on 100 scans each of four representative reconstruction kernels from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset and evaluated it on 240 withheld scans. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our method in both within manufacturer harmonization and cross-manufacture harmonization: Harmonizing hard-to-soft kernel images within a single manufacturer significantly reduces emphysema measurement discrepancies (p < 0.05). Across manufacturers, harmonizing all kernels to a reference soft kernel yields consistent emphysema quantification (p > 0.05) and preserves anatomical structures, as demonstrated by improved Dice similarity coefficient in skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue between harmonized and unharmonized images. These findings demonstrate that segmentation-driven anatomical regularization effectively addresses cross-manufacturer discrepancies, ensuring robust quantitative imaging.

    author = "Vibujithan Vigneshwaran and Emma A.M. Stanley and Raissa Souza and Erik Ohara and Matthias Wilms and Nils Forkert",
    abstract = "Although deep learning models can surpass human performance in many medical image analysis tasks, they remain vulnerable to algorithmic shortcuts, where spurious correlations in the data are exploited, which may lead to reduced trust in their predictions/classifications. This issue is especially concerning when models rely on protected attributes (e.g., sex, race, or site) as shortcuts. Such shortcut reliance not only impairs their ability to generalize to unseen datasets but also raises fairness concerns, ultimately undermining their purpose for computer-aided diagnosis. Previous techniques for analyzing protected attributes, such as supervised prediction layer information tests, only highlight the presence of protected attributes in the feature space but do not confirm their role in solving the primary task. Determining the impact of protected attributes as shortcuts is particularly challenging, as it requires knowing how a model would perform without those attributes — a counterfactual scenario typically unattaiw:nable in real-world data. As a workaround, researchers have addressed the absence of counterfactuals by generating synthetic datasets with and without protected attributes. In this study, we propose a novel approach to evaluate real-world datasets and determine the extent to which each protected attribute is used as a shortcut in a classification task. Therefore, we define and train a causal generative model to produce causally-grounded counterfactuals, removing protected attributes from activations and allowing us to measure their impact on model performance. Employing T1-weighted MRI data from 9 sites (835 subjects: 426 with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 409 healthy), we demonstrate that counterfactually removing the \'site\' attribute from the penultimate layer of a trained classification model reduced the AUROC for PD classification from 0.74 to 0.65, indicating a 9\% performance improvement achieved by using \'site\' as a shortcut. In contrast, counterfactually removing the \'sex\' attribute had minimal impact on performance, with only a slight change of 0.004, indicating that \'sex\' was not utilized as a shortcut by the classification model. The proposed method offers a robust framework for assessing shortcut utilization in medical image classification, paving the way for improved bias detection and mitigation in medical imaging tasks.

Accurately predicting future CT scans of early-stage IPF patients can aid in developing better treatment strategies, thereby improving survival outcomes. As inspired by the recent success of world models in generating video-based virtual physical worlds, we present the first world model for IPF, to synthesize realistic scans of early-stage IPF patients at any time point.

In the first stage, a 3D-VQ-GAN is trained to reconstruct CT volumes. In the second stage, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model is trained to capture the temporal dynamics of the quantised embeddings, which are generated by the encoder trained in the first stage. For clinical validation, we conduct survival analysis using imaging biomarkers derived from generated CT scans and achieve a C-index either better than or comparable to that of biomarkers derived from the real CT scans.

Their computational cost, however, grows quadratically with sequence length - which is problematic for certain 3D problems, e.g.  high-resolution diffusion models that require dozens of sampling steps. Flash attention addressed some limitations by optimising local memory access, but left the computational burden high. Quantising weights and activations for convolutions and fully binary networks are possible, but have to be trained at higher precision and often resulted in performance drops. For transformers recent studies have been limited to quantising weights in linear layers or exploiting the potential of sparsity in self-attention scores. We present a novel scheme that not only enables a binary precision computation of the self-attention at inference time but also extends this to the training of transformers. To achieve differentiability we combine the bitwise Hamming distance with a learnable scalar query and key weighting. In theory this yields a 16-32x more resource-efficiency in arithmetic operations and memory bandwidth. We evaluate our model on three tasks with sequence lengths of N>1000: classification of images without patch-embedding, semantic 2D MRI segmentation and 3D high-resolution diffusion models for inpainting and synthesis.

The lack of fully-sampled acquisitions, serving as ground truths, complicates the training of deep learning (DL) algorithms in a supervised manner.  To address this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled $k$-space data to train neural networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these approaches often fall short when compared to supervised learning (SL). We propose Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL), a novel training approach for DL-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in cases where target datasets containing fully-sampled $k$-space measurements are unavailable. JSSL operates by simultaneously training a model in a SSL setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a SL manner, utilizing proxy datasets with fully-sampled $k$-space data.

We expect to obtain larger intervals for difficult examples and smaller ones for easier examples to predict. A recently proposed calibration procedure suggests predicting the mean and the variance and scaling the variance on a validation set. Another calibration approach is based on applying conformal prediction to quantile regression. We show that assuming a Gaussian distribution to predict the variance followed by a non-parametric Conformal Prediction technique to scale the estimated variance is the most effective way of achieving a small confidence interval with a coverage guarantee.

Current research integrates pathological images to infer gene expression, addressing the high costs and time-consuming processes to generate spatial transcriptomics data. However, as spatial transcriptomics resolution continues to improve, existing methods remain primarily focused on gene expression prediction at low-resolution (55𝜇m) spot levels. These methods face significant challenges, especially the information bottleneck, when they are applied to high-resolution (8𝜇m) HD data. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MagNet, a multi-level attention graph network designed for accurate prediction of high-resolution HD data. MagNet employs cross-attention layers to integrate features from multi-resolution image patches hierarchically and utilizes a GAT-Transformer module to aggregate neighborhood information. By integrating multilevel features, MagNet overcomes the limitations posed by low-resolution inputs in predicting high-resolution gene expression. We systematically evaluated MagNet and existing ST prediction models on both a private spatial transcriptomics dataset and a public dataset at three different resolution levels. The results demonstrate that MagNet achieves state-of-the-art performance at both spot level and high-resolution bin levels, providing a novel methodology and benchmark for future research and applications in high-resolution HD-level spatial transcriptomics.

This study evaluates the efficacy of existing Deep Image Prior (DIP) frameworks for accelerated 3D LGE-MRI reconstruction. We comprehensively assess multiple DIP variants - vanilla DIP, reference-guided DIP, DIP with Total Variation, and self-guided DIP - on their ability to reconstruct high-quality isotropic (1.25mm$^3$) images from highly undersampled k-space data. Using data from 10 subjects, we demonstrate that self-guided DIP achieves superior reconstruction quality (PSNR: 32.8±1.2 dB, SSIM: 0.891±0.015 at 1/4th of acquisition time) compared to traditional compressed sensing and other DIP variants. Our evaluation shows that DIP-based reconstruction can maintain diagnostic quality with acquisition times reduced to 2-4 minutes, particularly in preserving thin left atrial wall details.

Chest-OMDL trains DL models using disease labels extracted by RadBERT from free-text radiology reports and multi-organ segmentation masks generated by the Segment Anything by Text (SAT) model, therefore reducing the need for manual annotation.

Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FCbecomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but it is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections.

However, traditional manual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming, labor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability, potentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology images continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis to address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing histopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML models are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and reflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively, particularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful orientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological biomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised segmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA) images from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The biomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution kernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of ML models in digital pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to improve diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of histopathology beyond prostate cancer through equivariant imaging.",

By leveraging these two outputs, our model effectively reconstructs instance-level segmentations. The proposed architecture results in significantly faster inference, reducing processing time by up to x5 compared to HoVer-Net, while achieving classification and detection performance comparable to State-of-the-Art models. Additionally, our approach demonstrates greater computational efficiency than CellViT and NuLite.

We present Sparse Temporal Attenuation Reconstruction (STAR), a novel approach using conditional neural fields that reconstructs tissue attenuation curves from sparse observations, allowing for reduced radiation exposure and motion sensitivity with CT perfusion, while enabling perfusion analysis from multiphase CT angiography. Our method generates full tissue attenuation curves using only 4 out of 30 observations.

Commonly used smoothness regularizers for image registration fail to integrate population statistics, leading to anatomically inconsistent transformations. Inverse consistency regularizers promote geometric consistency but lack population morphometrics integration. Regularizers that constrain deformation to low-dimensional manifold methods address this. However, they prioritize reconstruction over interpretability and neglect diffeomorphic properties, such as group composition and inverse consistency. We introduce MORPH-LER, a Log-Euclidean regularization framework for population-aware unsupervised image registration. MORPH-LER, learns population morphometrics from spatial transformations to guide and regularize registration networks, ensuring anatomically plausible deformations. It features a bottleneck autoencoder that computes the principal logarithm of deformation fields via iterative square-root predictions. It creates a linearized latent space that respects diffeomorphic properties and enforces inverse consistency. By integrating a registration network with a diffeomorphic autoencoder, MORPH-LER produces smooth, meaningful deformation fields. The framework offers two main contributions: (1) a data-driven regularization strategy that incorporates population-level anatomical statistics to enhance transformation validity and (2) a linearized latent space that enables compact and interpretable deformation fields for efficient population morphometrics analysis. We validate MORPH-LER across two families of deep learning-based registration networks, demonstrating its ability to produce anatomically accurate, computationally efficient, and statistically meaningful transformations on the OASIS-1 brain imaging dataset.",

    abstract = "Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets, leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges, traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical segmentation models in real-world applications.

This study conducts contrastive pretraining between longitudinal chest CTs and clinical variables on the patient level using a large public lung cancer screening dataset. Leveraging a time-distanced transformer to encode longitudinal imaging and an open-source text embedding to encode clinical variables, we optimize contrastive loss between the embedded modalities from same patient (positive pair) against those from different patients (negative pair). We find that finetuning the CLIP representation significantly improves prediction of lung cancer risk in two types of clinical populations (0.895 and 0.893 AUC) compared to conventional multimodal fusion (0.873 and 0.875 AUC) and single modality baselines.

Here, we propose a fully automated, volumetric, end-to-end trained network for simultaneous detection of standard cardiac planes and comprehensive left ventricular (LV) segmentation in the predicted short axis coordinate system. The architecture consists of a coarse segmentation module, a transformation module, and a fine segmentation module. The coarse segmentation module provides an initial segmentation of the full field of view (FOV) axial images at low resolution. The transformation module predicts the rotations corresponding to the standard cardiac planes (short axis, SAX; two chamber, 2CH; three chamber, 3CH; and four chamber, 4CH) and reformats the source volume into the predicted SAX coordinate system at high resolution. Finally, the fine segmentation module segments the narrow FOV, high resolution SAX volume. The dataset consisted of 313 CCTA studies partitioned into training, validation, and testing in an 80:10:10 split. Architectural decisions are justified using ablation experiments. On the test set, the proposed architecture achieved accurate plane predictions (mean angle errors of $9.1\pm6.2^\circ$, $9.5\pm5.4^\circ$, $9.0\pm5.9^\circ$, and $8.8\pm5.9^\circ$ for the SAX, 2CH, 3CH, and 4CH planes, respectively) and high quality segmentations (Dice scores of $0.955\pm0.008$, $0.928\pm0.016$, and $0.808\pm0.029$ for the bloodpool, myocardium, and trabeculations, respectively).

Our approach integrates optical coherence tomography (OCT) images with carefully selected clinical parameters through a cross-modal fusion architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to enhance feature interaction and predictive accuracy. We validate our framework across two clinically distinct real-world cohorts: treatment-naïve patients ($n=35$) receiving intensive anti-VEGF therapy and chronically treated patients ($n=20$) receiving sustained-release corticosteroid implants. This approach achieves mean absolute errors in post-treatment VA prediction of $3.07 \pm 0.82$ and $4.20 \pm 2.79$ Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, respectively, falling within the acceptable range of clinical measurement variability and meeting thresholds for statistically significant visual change detection with $\geq90\\%$ confidence.

Unlike point-prompted segmentation methods, such as those based on Segment-Anything Models, mesh prompting reduces the ambiguity associated with point prompts and provides a stronger shape prior, which is particularly advantageous for many medical applications. Our approach performs mesh-prompted segmentation by registering the signed distance function (SDF) of the mesh to the target image using a vector-field attention network trained with boundary-based loss terms. Before registration, the prompted mesh is roughly aligned with the structure in the target image using a center prompt provided by the user. This method allows for independent initialization of each structure\'s position and the prediction of deformation fields specific to each structure, which offers advantages over segmentation via direct image registration that typically relies on a single deformation field to accommodate all structures. Additionally, it preserves surface correspondence better than image registration using region-based loss terms. We evaluate our method on two CT datasets featuring common ear and body structures. A comparison of our technique with image registration and other state-of-the-art segmentation methods shows that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy.",

However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-corrective approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively because they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective learning that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence consensus regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable consensus regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the model to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two reasoning-guided simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets.

In this paper, we systematically address the question: \"in a non-interactive annotation pipeline, how should slices from cross-sectional medical images be selected for annotation to maximize the performance of the resulting deep learning segmentation models?\"We conducted experiments on 4 medical imaging segmentation tasks with varying annotation budgets, numbers of annotated cases, numbers of annotated slices per volume, slice selection techniques, and mask interpolations. We found that:1) It is almost always preferable to annotate fewer slices per volume and more volumes given an annotation budget. 2) Selecting slices for annotation by unsupervised active learning (UAL) is not superior to selecting slices randomly or at fixed intervals, provided that each volume is allocated the same number of annotated slices. 3) Interpolating masks between annotated slices rarely enhances model performance, with exceptions of some specific configuration for 3D models.},

    abstract = "Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly. This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training, SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical application scenarios. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Joey-Qi/SAIC.",

Surgical events are often characterized by specific tool-tissue interactions; for example, \"bleeding damage\" occurs when a tool unintentionally cuts a tissue, leading to blood flow. Despite progress in general event classification, recognizing and forecasting events in medical contexts remains challenging due to data scarcity and the complexity of these events. To address these challenges, we propose a method utilizing video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) for surgical event recognition. This approach focuses the network on the most informative areas of the video while minimizing the need for extensive annotations. We introduce a novel mask sampling technique based on an estimated prior probability map derived from optical flow. We hypothesize that leveraging prior knowledge of tool-tissue interactions will enable the network to concentrate on the most relevant regions in the video.We propose two methods for estimating the prior probability map: (a) retaining areas with the fastest motion and (b) incorporating an additional encoding pathway for optical flow. Our extensive experiments on the public dataset CATARACTS and our in-house neurosurgical data demonstrate that optical flow-based masking consistently outperforms random masking strategies of VideoMAE in phase and event classification tasks. We find that an optical flow encoder enhances classification accuracy by directing the network\'s focus to the most relevant information, even in regions without rapid motion.Finally, we investigate sequential and multi-task training strategies to identify the best-performing model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art by 5\\% on the CATARACTS dataset and 27\\% on our in-house neurosurgical data.},

This approach utilized the extracted language labels without requiring expert annotations for training. We curated a large dataset of almost 3,000 pediatric wrist X-ray images and their corresponding radiology reports. Validation and testing were conducted on a smaller subset of 300 expert-annotated images.Our findings indicate that this pseudo-blind training strategy significantly enhances the base accuracy of the pre-trained model, achieving performance comparable to models fine-tuned with meticulously labeled expert annotations.

Combined with a small amount of weak supervision,  the proposed MedCL is able to segment both regular organs and challenging irregular pathologies. We implement MedCL based on SAM and UNet backbones, and evaluate the performance on three open datasets of regular structure (MSCMRseg), multiple organs (BTCV) and irregular pathology (MyoPS).

We address this by introducing MAIS, a Memory-Attention mechanism for Interactive Segmentation that stores past user inputs and segmentation states, enabling temporal context integration.

Since each foundation model was trained on datasets collected from different sources under varying settings, the learned representations reflect different characteristics to some extent. These differences suggest that leveraging the information of multiple models could improve generalization and robustness compared to using a single model. In this study, we investigate foundation model ensembles for predicting lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer across three different datasets. By comparing ensemble models with individual ones, we demonstrate that ensembling multiple foundation models improves performance in whole-slide imaging for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.",

While both strategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations with histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the limitedvisual ROI saliency in histology images and scarce localization cues. They also face thewell-known issue of asynchronous convergence between classification and localization tasks.The two-step approach is sub-optimal because it is constrained to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for localization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when appliedto out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for WSOLis introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is performed in the pixel-feature space of animage encoder that is shared with classification. This allows learning discriminant featuresand accurate delineation of foreground/background regions to support ROI localizationand image classification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective foreground/backgroundpixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that allows for spatial object localization.Using partial-cross entropy, PixelCAM is trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from apretrained WSOL model. Both image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained simultaneouslyusing standard gradient descent.

We utilized a large multi-centric dataset comprising T1-weighted DCE MR images from nine clinical sites across seven countries, encompassing diverse imaging characteristics and scanner types. We evaluated several models, including the standard nnU-Net, an adapted nnU-Net with modifications to reduce false positives, a coarse-resolution version thereof, the transformer-based SwinUNETR-V2, and nnDetection.The standard nnU-Net achieved a high lesion-level sensitivity of 83.8\% but produced an average of 3.334 false positives per case, which is impractical for clinical use. The adapted (coarse) nnU-Net significantly reduced false positives to 0.666 (0.397) per case with a slight decrease in sensitivity to 79.9\% (75.8\%). SwinUNETR-V2 achieved comparable performance to the adapted nnU-Net. nnDetection outperformed nnU-Net in the high-sensitivity region, but performed worse than the adapted models in the lower-sensitivity region, with respect to false positives. To conclude, the nnU-Net again provides a good baseline, but our lesion detection task motivates adaptations to reduce the number of false positives.",

Manual QA methods are subjective, prone to inter-rater variability, and impractical for high-throughput workflows. Existing automated QA methods often lack generalizability to diverse datasets or fail to provide interpretable insights into the causes of poor image quality. To address these limitations, we introduce an unsupervised and interpretable QA framework for multi-contrast MR images that quantifies artifact severity. By assigning a numerical score to each image, our method enables objective, consistent evaluation of image quality and highlights specific levels of artifact presence that can impair downstream analysis. Our framework employs an unsupervised contrastive learning approach, leveraging simulated artifact transformations, including random bias, noise, anisotropy, and ghosting, to train the model without requiring manual labels or preprocessing. A margin-based contrastive loss further enables differentiation between varying levels of artifact severity. We validate our framework using simulated artifacts on a public dataset and real artifacts on a private clinical dataset, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for automatic MR image QA. By efficiently evaluating image quality and identifying artifacts prior to data processing, our approach streamlines QA workflows and enhances the reliability of subsequent analyses in both research and clinical settings.",

    abstract = "Contrastive learning, a typical self-supervised learning strategy, operates on bringing similar data together while pushing dissimilar data apart in latent space. This approach extracts robust and discriminative representations, thus being widely used in natural computer vision tasks, such as object classification. However, unlike natural images, medical images (e.g., retinal images) tend to share substantial similarities in imaging area and anatomical tissues, leading to a denser distribution in latent space. As a result, the default use of strong augmentations in contrastive learning potentially exacerbates this intensive distribution in retinal images, making it difficult to distinguish between genuinely similar and dissimilar data, and therefore hindering model pre-training convergence. In this paper, we hypothesise that weaker augmentations are better suited to contrastive learning for medical image applications, and we investigate model performance under various augmentation strategies. Our study includes six publicly available retinal datasets covering multiple clinically relevant tasks. We assess the models\' performance and generalizability via extensive experiments. The model pre-trained with weak augmentation outperforms the one pre-trained with strong augmentation, achieving approximately a 6\\% increase in AUPR ($P$$<$0.001) and a 12.5\\% increase in sensitivity ($P$$<$0.001) on MESSIDOR-2. Similar improvements are observed across other datasets. Our findings suggest that optimizing the scale of augmentation is critical for enhancing the efficacy of contrastive learning in medical imaging.

Many of these tasks, such as cancer staging or risk stratification, exhibit an inherent ordinal structure; however, existing solutions often reduce them to binary or purely nominal classifications, ignoring the valuable ordering information. Simultaneously, privacy and regulatory concerns have spurred the adoption of Federated Learning (FL), enabling collaborative model training without centralising sensitive patient data. Yet, FL in real-world medical scenarios faces significant challenges arising from heterogeneous client data, particularly when institutions differ widely in case severity or label distribution. In this work, we conduct the first in-depth study of Federated Ordinal Learning (FOL), introducing ordinal classification paradigms into FL pipelines and systematically evaluating their performance under increasing levels of data heterogeneity. We assess the benefits of ordinal classification within four FL frameworks: standard Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and three heterogeneity-focused approaches (FedProx, MOON, and FedALA). Our experiments reveal that ordinal methods can effectively maintain class ordering information even when institutional data exhibit severe imbalance or missing classes, offering valuable insights for developing robust, privacy-preserving AI systems in medical imaging. However, ordinal approaches still suffer from performance degradation in highly heterogeneous FL settings, underscoring the need for dedicated research on FL methods that explicitly account for ordinality.",

Training a separate component for confidence prediction is relatively fast, and can easily be adapted to different quality metrics. However, the resulting estimates are usually not sufficiently reliable under domain shifts, for example when images are taken with different devices. We introduce a novel adversarial strategy for training confidence predictors for the widely used U-Net architecture that greatly improves such generalization. It is based on creating adversarial image perturbations, aimed at substantially decreasing segmentation quality, via the gradients of the confidence predictor, leading to images outside of the original training distribution. We observe that these perturbations initially have little effect on segmentation quality. However, including them in the training gradually improves the confidence predictor\'s understanding of what actually affects segmentation quality when moving outside of the training distribution. On two different medical image segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that this strategy substantially improves estimates of volumetric and surface Dice on out-of-distribution images.",
